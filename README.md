## About

This repository contains solutions to tasks assigned during the Structured Programming course. Each task is designed to reinforce concepts such as control structures, functions, arrays, loops, and other fundamental principles of structured programming.

## Tasks

1. **Task 1: Basic Control Structures**
    - Description: Implement basic control structures such as if-else statements and switch-case statements.
    - Solution: [task1_solution.c](task1_solution.c)

2. **Task 2: Loops and Iteration**
    - Description: Practice loops including for, while, and do-while loops.
    - Solution: [task2_solution.c](task2_solution.c)

3. **Task 3: Functions**
    - Description: Implement and utilize functions for code modularity and reusability.
    - Solution: [task3_solution.c](task3_solution.c)

4. **Task 4: Arrays**
    - Description: Work with arrays and practice array manipulation and traversal.
    - Solution: [task4_solution.c](task4_solution.c)

5. **Task 5: File Handling**
    - Description: Read from and write to files, and handle file input/output operations.
    - Solution: [task5_solution.c](task5_solution.c)
